  "ai_image_prompt": "A celebratory 'Level Complete' screen background in 3D voxel art. Fireworks (made of cubes) are exploding in a night sky. A podium in the center with a spotlight shining on it (empty space for final text). Confetti falls from the top. The ground is covered in pixelated flowers and treasure chests. Very colorful, high energy, positive vibes to end the presentation."
