  "user_notes": "Left side is for 'The Problem' (Boring lists), Right side is for 'The Solution' (RPG Fun).",
  "ai_image_prompt": "A split-screen composition 3D render. The left side is desaturated, grey, and features a stack of boring 3D voxel spreadsheets and a dusty punch clock. The right side is bursting with color, featuring a magical pixel-art loot chest opening with light beams, floating XP stars, and a colorful voxel character jumping with joy. A distinct lightning bolt divider separates the two worlds. Leave empty space in the top-left and top-right for text headers. Retro-futuristic style."
