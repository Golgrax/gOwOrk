  "ai_image_prompt": "A close-up 3D voxel view of a fantasy RPG 'Quest Board' made of pixelated wood. The board is pinned with 4 distinct, blank parchment papers (where I will put text). The background is a blurry bustling medieval-style office tavern. Soft, warm lighting. The parchments should look empty but illuminated by a nearby lantern. The style is charming, chunky voxel art like Minecraft meets Stardew Valley. No text on the papers."
