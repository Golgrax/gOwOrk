  "ai_image_prompt": "A 3D voxel render of a 'Mission Control' center. A large curved console desk with multiple blank monitor screens facing the viewer. The screens should be dark glass (empty for overlays). The room feels like a sci-fi command center but built with blocks. Red and Blue status lights. In the background, a large digital map of the world. High contrast, professional but gamified look. No text on screens."
