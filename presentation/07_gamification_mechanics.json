  "ai_image_prompt": "An abstract, stylized background featuring floating 3D voxel mathematical symbols (+, -, %), gold coins, and experience stars. In the center, a large, glowing mechanical gear mechanism made of gold blocks. The composition is open and airy, leaving the left and right sides mostly clear for bulleted text. The background color is a deep, rich purple to make white text pop. Magical particle effects floating around."
