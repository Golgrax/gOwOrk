  "ai_image_prompt": "A first-person view of a high-tech voxel workbench. On the desk, there are two large, semi-transparent holographic frames floating in the air (placeholders for screenshots). Scattered on the desk are 3D pixel items: a red baseball cap, a pixelated donut, and a gold coin. The background is a cozy, pixelated break room with a window looking out at a digital sunset. Warm, inviting atmosphere. 'Fancy cool' game UI aesthetic."
